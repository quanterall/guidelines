# Guidelines

- [Guidelines](#guidelines)
  - [General code guidelines](#general-code-guidelines)

The goal of this repository is to hold a current view of general guidelines that
are useful to consider for development on Quanterall projects, for the benefit
of yourself, your colleagues and by extension the stakeholders. They are not and
will never be absolute truths, but rather suggestions for consideration.

[This file](./general-code-guidelines.md) describes a currently incomplete set of principles and
guidelines that are worth considering and reflecting on.
