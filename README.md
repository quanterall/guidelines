The goal of this repository is to hold a current view of general guidelines that
are useful to consider for development on Quanterall projects, for the benefit
of yourself, your colleagues and by extension the stakeholders. They are not and
will never be absolute truths, but rather suggestions for consideration.

## The most important guideline

Guidelines are not rules. Don't follow them blindly. Reflect on their application in your context
and act accordingly. Once you've reflected on them in enough different contexts you will have
developed enough taste to know where they don't apply or where they are less important, as well as
where they simply can't apply without trading off something else that is also important.

## General code guidelines

[This file](./general-code-guidelines.md) describes a currently incomplete set of principles and
guidelines that are worth considering and reflecting on.
